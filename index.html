                <p>Born in Canada, raised in Turkey, living in the US. After moving so many times earlier on in my life, 
                    I've finally settled in Seattle, having lived here for over 10 years now. </p>
                <p>I went into college with an initial desire to study medicine, and following this desire I got my bachelor's in Physiology and graduated in 2016. 
                    After graduating, I had a couple of jobs in healthcare, and I currently work at a dialysis center as a technician. After realizing medicine 
                    isn't the path I want to pursue, I decided to go for a career change and go for coding!</p>
                <p>My hobbies are playing basketball, soccer, football, lifting weights, along with hiking and watching tv shows!</p>
